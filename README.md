# Andrea-capstone-project
culminating project that uses python 101 techniques
# Purpose/Problem Statement
- What does your program do? What problem/need is it addressing?
  - The issue that the code solves is creating appoiments online in a simple way and easy way. 
  
# Target Audience
- Who is this for? (ex: students, gamers, young adults, etc.)
  - The anital target for this projectw would be those who have a busy scedale and wish to make a fast and quick apppoiment, as well as those wo jsut seek to check if they
   have an appoiment, However the targets are wide rage from teens to elders. 
  
# Solution + Limitations
- How does your project solve the problem? Are there actions your program would do to solve the problem but doesnâ€™t do?
  - The code solves the issue by making it simple for the users to follow. I think outputting avaliable infromation from the list could be more effinate to make it easier
    for users to choose from, another issues is allowing the user to input information in any form instead of specific format. 
  
# Key Features / Key Components
 - List major parts of your program (what the user can do or see).
   - The user is able to input a name (or last name) and gets input either whne that person has an appoiment or a message sayign there is no person of that name within the lists
     they are also allowed to make a new appoiment with the avialable days and times. With in the code there are lists that conntain avaibale days and times. but also a dicionary
     with information about different paients. Key features are the define fucntions that simpies simple code, such as adding and removing information from lists.

# Technical Challenges + Future Plans
- What was hard to figure out? What do you wish you could add if you had more time or more experience?
  - figuring out whhere to start and how to simplfy certain codes. Despite it being a simple project and having a simple goal there is a lot of off the screen code reqired to it,
    in the future I wish to simplfy more code as well as add more feature for when making an appiment, to what the paient wishes to come in for, Another feaure i would like to add
    is a feature that the code assins the user with a doctor and allows the doctor to log in and see who they got to see. There is a lot of potential that  i see within this
    small project.
